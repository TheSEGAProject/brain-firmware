*		 1. Added code to handle the FRAM and the FLASH.
*		 2. Corrected the slave SPI code so that on power up the brain drains
*		    any residual charge off the slave SPI port before the brain checks

*		 3. Created so that ver V2.02 is what we sent to DUKE
*

*		    look like a button push
*		14. Fixed the 16 bit internal clock rollover bug.

*		16, Code has gone through Alpha test --- adding patches for bugs and
*		    deficiencies.
*
* V1.15	05/27/2003 wzr
*		 1. Started the operation mode section of the code.
*
* V1.14 03/31/2003 wzr
*		 1. separated the compilations so that Hubs and Spokes are separated,
*		 2. separated compilations so that serial numbers     are separated.
*		 3. Added parameterizations for message indexes and added calculations
*		    for message lengths in tics.
*

*
* V1.12 11/08/2002 wzr
*		 1. Converting this code over to the 18F8720 processor and the PICMICRO
*		    C18 compiler.
*
* V1.11 10/21/2002 wzr
*		 1. Starting in on the network discovery setion of main.
*		 2. Removed the real time clk from the hardware and are now using
*		    Timer 1 to implement a julian real time clk.
*		 3. Cleaned out all the old code from I2C and CLK.
*		 4. Added module random number generator.
*		 5. Added compiler switches so that Hubs and Spokes can be separated
*		    and added compiler switches to enter serial numbers.
*
* V1.10 10/07/2002 wzr
*		 1. Incorporating the CRC calculattion module.
*		 2. Added two new modules I2C and CLK.
*		 3. Added new module MISC for various routines that have no home.
*		 4. Added new module DISK0 for static ram routine.
*
* V1.09 09/11/2002 wzr
*		 1. The half duplex radio link is working and we are now implementing a
*		    ver that takes periodic temperature data, and sends it out to the
*		    other computer.
*		 2. We ran out of bank0 memory in the compiler and got diverted to
*		    retrieving more memory for the compiler.  Step one is to convert
*		    the radio code to 10MHZ clk for testing purposes.
*		 3. Moved the msg_buffer to bank2 so bank 0 will have more room.
*		 4. Added timer routine for approx delays.
*		 5. Changed A/D routine to do averaging on demand.
*
*
* V1.08 09/05/2002 wzr
*		 1. Transmitter and receiver are working with the Brent radio boards
*		    and this ver is to hookup a half duplex com link between
*		    computers.
*		 2. Changed the receiver so that it no longer waits for a transmission.
*		    The call starts up the interrupt receiver and then immediately returns
*		    to the caller.  Communication between ground and interrupt level is
*		    accomplished via the flag1_byte & flag2_byte.
*		 3. Found numerous bugs relating to bit placement and union definitions,
*		    Finally forced the flag bytes and latch bytes to fixed locations so
*		    that the compiler was happy.
*
* V1.07 08/29/2002 wzr
*		 1. Patched a bug in the transmitter init code that was causing an init
*		    error in the radio.
*		 2. Changed transmitter calculation for new radio clk and added ability
*		    to do on the fly channel calculation and selection.
*
* V1.06 08/28/2002 wzr
*		This is simply a clean-up ver of V1.05, where all the missing
*		defines have been setup and we are getting ready for the new ground
*		that will be covered now that we have achieved the C-ASM merger.
*
* V1.05	08/28/2002 wzr
*		This is now the new base line.  We have got 'C' calling the radio
*		send and receive routines that are imbedded in CSTARTUP.ASM.  They
*		share a common file called flags.h that has the usage of the 
*		oscilliscope pulses defined.  The 'C' compiler we are using is IAR's
*		ver V2.20A/W32 and the assembler is IAR's also.
*
* V1.02	08/12/2002 wzr
*		Adding a C dummy function to C which looks like the ASM radio routines.
*
* V1.01 08/08/2002 wzr
*		Converting this to a simple C shell program to shoehorn in the
*		asm radio routines
*
* V1.00 05/03/2002 wzr
*		Started
